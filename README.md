# Discordo

This is a personal fork of [Discordo](https://github.com/ayn2opdiscordo) with several personal modifications.

Color and formatting is slightly modified and unread indicators are shown for any channels that recieve new messages during the duration of your session.

- Lightweight
- Secure
- Configurable
- Cross-platform
- Minimalistic
- Feature-rich
  - Mouse & clipboard support
  - 2-Factor authentication
  - Partial [Discord-flavored markdown](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/210298617-Markdown-Text-101-Chat-Formatting-Bold-Italic-Underline-)
  - Unread indicators

## Installation

You will have to build this package from source.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vmhl87/discordo
cd discordo
go build .
```

### Linux clipboard support

- `xclip` or `xsel` for X11 (`apt install xclip`)
- `wl-clipboard` for Wayland (`apt install wl-clipboard`)

## Usage

1. Run the `discordo` executable with no arguments.

> If you are logging in using an authentication token, provide the `token` command-line flag to the executable (eg: `--token "OTI2MDU5NTQxNDE2Nzc5ODA2.Yc2KKA.2iZ-5JxgxG-9Ub8GHzBSn-NJjNg"`). The token is stored securely in the default OS-specific keyring.

2. Enter your email and password and click on the "Login" button to continue.
